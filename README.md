# Cpp-codecademy-challenge

Little Mac is an interplanetary space boxer, who is trying to win championship belts for various weight categories on other planets within the solar system.

Write a space.cpp program that helps him keep track of his target weight by:

1. It should ask him what his earth weight is.

2. Ask him to enter a number for the planet he wants to fight on.

3. It should then compute his weight on the destination planet.

Here is the table of conversion:


| # | Planets | Relative Gravity |
| --|:-------:| ----:|
| 1 | Mercury | 0.38 |
| 2 | Venus   | 0.91 |
| 3 | Mars    | 0.38 |
| 4 | Jupiter | 2.34 |
| 5 | Saturn  | 1.06 |
| 6 | Uranus  | 0.92 |
| 7 | Neptune | 1.19 |
